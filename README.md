Self-teaching programmer, always learning, always expanding my horizons.
Love all things movies, tech, fish, and horses.

As the IT Manager, sitting below the CTO,
I have brought my passion for coding and problem solving to the team and I have created numerous internal automations,
scripts, and tools to assist myself and the teams I lead to support the company needs to the best of my ability. 

Leading a team of 11 staff in 3 teams across the UK and Pakistan, 
I understand what it takes to manage my time and the time of others in an effective way, to develop strong relationships
with both clients and co-workers, and to maintain a professional and approachable attitude as a representative for my company and team.
